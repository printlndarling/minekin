"""The runner's shell glue is evidence-bearing, so two silent failures are checked.

Both of these have already cost a verification run, and both fail in ways that
look like a conclusion about the code under test rather than a fault in the
harness:

* A CRLF line ending breaks `#!/usr/bin/env bash` into `bash\\r`, so the script
  dies before its first command with `No such file or directory` — while
  `bash -n script.sh` still reports it as syntactically fine, because a comment
  with a stray CR is a comment.
* An environment variable read into a local and then never used makes the
  feature it names silently absent. The entity collection run is the example:
  `MINEKIN_DOMAIN_SUMMON=minecraft:pig` was set, the variable was read, the tool
  was never told, and the client reported zero visible entities — which is
  exactly what a working entity path would report about an empty world.
